------------- Changes I made for converting drupal 6 module to drupal 7 --------------

* I am following all rules for writing a code.
* hook_perm is changed to hook_permission.
* In hook_theme 'arguments' variable is changed to 'variables' or 'render element'.
* hook_block is removed from drupal 7, and a set of methods are included for the same functionality.
  I have used two methods named hook_block_view() and hook_block_info().
* hook_block_info() defines all blocks provided by this module. Here blocks are delaired dynamically so I have put loop over there.
* hook_block_view() returns rendered view of block.Here value of 'delta' is unique.
